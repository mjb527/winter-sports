        A lot of people don't like the winter. We're here to change that.
      </u></h2>

        Winter is beautiful. Winter is cozy. Winter can be the most fun time of the year. Most people just don't know how to make the most of the ice and snow.
        Growing up, we all loved snow days; they brought no school, building snowmen and snowforts with friends, drinking hot cocoa, and time to enjoy some of
        the best the season had to offer.

      <div className="mb-4">
        Now that we're older, it can be difficult to enjoy the cold and the weather that comes with it. Shoveling snow and driving during a blizzard can be
        near traumatizing. However, picking up a winter hobby can be a great way to relax, exercise, and make awesome memories. Among the most popular activities
        are skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating, all of which can be challenging, but also great fun when you learn the ins and outs!

        While this site cannot replace proper instruction and practice, we aim to help you understand the basics so that you are prepared when you start out.
        We always encourage you to take lessons for more dangerous activities, and you should always be in groups of two or more in case of injury, regardless
        of the sport or season. It's more fun with a friend anyway!

      <h2><u>Now some bad news...</u></h2>

      <div className="mb-4">
        Millions of people world wide participate in outdoor winter activities. It may have became a part of their lives at a young age, or could have became a passion
        later in life. Unfortunately, climate change and environmental destruction are making it more difficult to do what we love. Even if you do not like the winter,
        a warming planet will spell bad news for us all, and can make several places around the world unlivable sooner than we would hope.
